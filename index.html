	<p> The API I chose was on a site called http://uinames.com, but I accessed the API information through the github, at https://github.com/thm/uinames. This API generates random names, and also generates a gender and a region for each name. For this API request, I only requested 25 names (just first and last name). With this API, there are multiple optional parameters, where you can choose to, for example, only generate female names, names from certain regions, or names of certain lengths. This API would be helpful in a situation where you need examples names from certain regions, like France or China. It could also be helpful if you want to search for potential baby names, where you could put in the gender of your baby and also the region that you come from. </p>
